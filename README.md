### Description
Welcome to the KU-CPGR (Korea University Center for ProteoGenome Research) website repository.

This repository contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript code for the KU CPGR website. It has been developed for the first two months during my
internship at KU CPGR (May 2020 - Dec 2020)

The the repository is not up to date compared to the actual website, since I am not in charge anymore of maintaining the website.
